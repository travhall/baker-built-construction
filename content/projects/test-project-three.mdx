This whole-home remodel project centered around transforming the dated kitchen and master bathroom into bright, modern spaces that better suited the homeowners' needs. In the kitchen, we removed walls to create an open-concept layout, installed custom cabinetry, quartz countertops, and high-end appliances. The updated master bath features a spa-inspired shower, freestanding tub, and designer finishes that elevated the overall feel of the home.
