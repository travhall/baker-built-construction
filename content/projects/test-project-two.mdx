After years of weathering Minnesota's harsh winters, this lakeside home was in need of a major exterior facelift. Our team expertly installed a new architectural asphalt roof, James Hardie fiber cement siding, and energy-efficient windows to breathe new life into the home's curb appeal. The transformation was completed with updated landscaping and a refreshed front porch, giving the home a modern yet timeless look.
